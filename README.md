# hello-worldd
there was a mistake at the other stuff
I've come to love Javascript very much. 
Though there's lots of practicing to do but i will acomplish Javascript!(if there's a sentence like that).
i will overcome.
i had started coding a long time ago  ut i got frustrated and stooped.
athis time around, i can't get frustrated anymore.
